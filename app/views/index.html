          <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Prototypes for specific updates to the 'as is' application</h1>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v1/start">Version 1 - alternative address</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: Not everyone will know what address their benefit is registered to, so gathering where they live and letters sent will be enough to match addresses in our systems.</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Start page</li>
            <li>Start question about whether you're the applicant</li>
            <li>Address question around assumption above</li>
          </ul>
          <p><a class="govuk-button" href="/v1/start">Start - version 1.0</a></p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v2/start">Version 2 - alternative address</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: Everyone knows what address their benefit is registered to, so asking for that address will be enough to match addresses in our systems, and then offer them an alternate correspondence address.</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Start page</li>
            <li>Start question about whether you're the applicant</li>
            <li>Address question around assumption above</li>
          </ul>
          <p><a class="govuk-button" href="/v2/start">Start - version 2.0</a></p>
  
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v3/start">Version 3</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: Disregarded</p>

          <p><a class="govuk-button" href="/v3/start">Start - version 3.0</a></p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v4/start">Version 4 - summary page</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: People will be more likely to check their answers and read the declaration if these are on the same page, as the the former must be done to accept the latter.</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Same content as version 1</li>
            <li>Check answers showing full range of possible questions with declaration on same page</li>

          </ul>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v5/start">Version 5 - summary page</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: People will be more likely to check their answers and read the declaration if these are split over two pages, as otherwise there's too much to read and process at once.</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Same content as version 1</li>
            <li>Check answers on its own page</li>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v6/find-address">Version 6 - find address by postcode</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: People will be more likely to enter the correct address that can be processed by robotics (and not fail) if they enter the essential parts and the system automatically fills in the rest.</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Postcode and house number fields for lookup</li>
            <li>Select address from those returned</li>

          </ul>
          <p><a class="govuk-button" href="/v6/find-address">Start - version 6.0</a></p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/v7/start">Version 7 - savings amount</a></h2>
          <p>Assumption: If the amount of savings is recorded in the application then they don't have to contacted to find out this figure, speeding up the application process.</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Savings amount if 'yes' is selected</li>
